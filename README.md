# CureViolenceCU
￼
## Q1: Motivation and Background
Cure Violence is a non-profit focused on stopping the spread of violence (e.g., gun violence) in communities (both domestic and international) by using the methods and strategies associated with disease control – detecting and interrupting conflicts, identifying and treating the highest risk individuals, and changing social norms. Specifically, they focus on:
* Detecting and interrupting potentially violent conflicts by preventing retaliations and mediating conflicts by being on-the- ground within communities
* Identifying and treating highest risk through assessing high risk candidates, changing behavior, and providing treatment through 1-on-1 case work
* Mobilizing the community to change norms by responding to every shooting, organize community events and people, and spreading positive norms

## Q2: The Data Set
This project will seek to combine / cross reference internal and external data sets appropriately to meet project scope and fulfill research goals. Cure Violence collects data on a regular basis from each of the communities their custom model is deployed and executed within. This internal data source is comprised of both qualitative and quantitative data provided by the members they embed within communities. The external data sources considered as a part of this proposal would include criminal databases from domestic law enforcement departments, census data, economic data figures (e.g., geographic poverty), budgetary / funding data of governments entities, non-profit data sets (e.g., [guidestar.org](http://www.guidestar.org)), and other cost saving data from various sectors (e.g., healthcare).

  1. Internal sources - Data collected at the community level by employees embedded into the community hosted in an internal data base.  In addition, there is reporting data found on the Cure Violence website for the typical types of analysis they have produced in the past.  We’d use this as an initial basis.
  2. External Sources Considered -  Local / state law enforcement databases; Gun registry databases; Social Media data associated with gun violence (with geo tagged); GDP/Per capita / income data from census.  Note: Some considerations we have had would be to think through how police blotters will provide some unique data and perhaps an aspect of predictive event timing to help take a more active rather than reactive approach to gun control

## Q3: Project Overview
Cure Violence as an organization uses data to assess and demonstrate impact and ROI to key stakeholders and funders. Cure Violence consistently strives to demonstrate tangible value propositions for the cities and communities to want to invest into their model for long term cost savings for stakeholders within the community and other sectors (e.g., healthcare, law enforcement, criminal justice, et.) However, due to on-going funding constraints and/or cutbacks within local and state governments, and other private institutions, Cure Violence is seeking to use data to inform their strategic direction going forward. The organization currently has an expiring strategic plan and is seeking insight through a data- driven approach that leverages both their internal database and external data sources to inform their strategic direction. Staff members from the Booz Allen Hamilton Strategic Innovation Group (SIG) NextGen Analytics and Data Science team will serve as project mentors for this effort.

## Q4: Research Goals
1. Demonstrate, by using data techniques such as data wrangling and cleaning, analysis, prototyping models, and visualization, how Cure Violence unique operating model can be deployed across different geographies to reduce violence and increase cost savings to stakeholders both direct (e.g., communities) and indirect (e.g., other sectors such as healthcare, law enforcement, etc.) within communities and cities of Cure Violence operations.
2. Data analysis and/or model to inform growth of existing program services
  1. Determine the areas of opportunities for the existing Cure Violence model.
    1. Analyze and report cost savings of Cure Violence approach for direct and indirect stakeholders within communities and cities of existing programs to establish organizational benchmark
    2. Compare and contrast organizational benchmark with industry standards
    3. Identify gaps in service, demand levels (e.g., funding, violence level, potential cost saving to stakeholders, etc.) in opportunity areas (e.g., top 3-5 cities) and correlate them to Cure Violence Model to provide highest possible success areas for next operating efforts
    4. Identify trouble areas that would benefit form Cure Violence model. Associate violence levels and demographic data (e.g., capital economy, cost savings to stakeholders)
    5. Provide data analysis and visualize of this effort
3. Data analysis and/or model to inform diversification of service (i.e., new areas of violence)
  1. Determine areas where a “Violence Focused Model” can be used to tackle other forms of violence with the intention of Cure Violence targeting a diversification of services to communities
  1. Provide data analysis and visualize of this effort related to factors of funding, cost savings to stakeholders, violence levels, and other economic factors (e.g., capital economy)
4. Data to inform potential strategic partners & alliances
  1. Assess environment for organizations (e.g., funding institutions, governments) focused on violence reduction and provide prioritization of strategic partners and alliances within existing programs and new service areas

## Q5: Suggested Output
1. Data and Operating Strategy Document for Cure Violence - Final Report
  1. Abstract Summary
  2. Approach – description of data driven process from ideation to formalization of recommendations
  3. Consolidated findings and analysis to inform strategic direction
  4. Operational Recommendations for Cure Violence for scale and prioritization
  5. Data Strategy recommendations for Cure Violence going forward
  6. Lessons learned and follow on work suggestions

## Q6: Product Follow-Ons (e.g., apps)
1. Provide additional insight into formulating data sharing strategies (e.g., API) for Cure Violence 
2. Cure Violence data collection process (e.g., mobile) within communities
